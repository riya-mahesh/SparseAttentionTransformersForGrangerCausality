This project establishes causal links by generating a causation matrix using Sparse-Attention Transformers and Granger Causlity. The linear dataset can be found in the ```experiments``` folder.
Run the code using the following command ```python3 metrics.py``` with the appropriate dataset path and the f1-score and AUC-ROC scores will be placed in the ```results``` folder.
